# Projects with description
These implementations were developed for the Algorithms And Data Structures classes.
1. Sorting Algorithms - Comparison of different sorting algorithms: insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, heap sort, and quicksort.
2. Dynamic Lists and BST Trees - Comparison of creation, deletion, and search time, as well as the differences between the height of average BST and AVL trees.
3. Graphs - Comparison of list and matrix graph representations, and MST algorithm.
4. Euler and Hamiltonian Cycles - Investigating Euler and Hamiltonian Cycles in graphs.
5. The Knapsack Problem - Comparison of algorithm performances for solving the Knapsack Problem.
