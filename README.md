# Projects with description
1. Sorting algoritms - comparison of different sorting algoritms: insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, heap sort, quick sort
2. Dynamic lists and BST trees - comparision of creation, deletion and search time, differences between height of average BST and AVL trees
3. Graphs - comparison of list and matrix for graph representation, MST algorithm
4. Euler_Hamilton_Cycles - figure it out
5. The knapsack problem - comparision of different algorithms' performances for solving the knapsack problem
